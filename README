# Health Care App - project in database technology

# About
The developed application is an information system for a healthcare center.
There are three different actors: administrators, doctors, and patients, who
will use the application. The information system is designed to store all essential
information in a database, which will then be retrieved and presented for various purposes
in a user interface. The main goal is to gain knowledge in the use of databases in programming
contexts, as well as in the design and construction of databases. The program runs on a
PostgreSQL database.
